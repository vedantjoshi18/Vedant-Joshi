Hi there, I'm Vedant Joshi👋

I build, I secure, and I create.
I'm a passionate developer and security enthusiast with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant, secure solutions. My world revolves around the logic of code, the strategy of digital defense, and the art of a well-told story.

💡 About Me
I see technology as a powerful tool for both creation and protection. My journey has taken me from building robust applications to understanding the intricate dance of digital security. I thrive on challenges and am constantly exploring the ever-evolving landscape of tech.

👨‍💻 I spend my days architecting software and my nights exploring digital fortresses.

🔭 I’m currently sharpening my skills in ethical hacking and building a new project in Java.
